/** How the batch save/ack works:
 *
 *  When we send a batch for enrichment, we call the lustre_changelog_save_batch
 *  function to record the last changelog index for that batch. When a thread
 *  finishes enriching its sub-batch, it calls the lustre_changelog_ack_batch
 *  function, which decrements the ack_required counter. If ack_required reaches
 *  0, it means that all threads have finished enriching the batch, and the
 *  changelogs for that batch can be acknowledged.
 *
 *  However, thereâ€™s a trickier case where a newer batch might finish before an
 *  older one. In that case, we need to check if there is no older batches that
 *  aren't done before acknowledging the changelog.

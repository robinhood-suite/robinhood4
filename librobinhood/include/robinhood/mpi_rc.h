/**
 * @file
 *
 * These functions provide a way to atomically setup/cleanup MPI across plugins.
 * For instance, if two backends use MPI, they will both call
 * MPI_Init/MPI_Finalize at some point. We need to make sure that MPI_Finalize
 * is only called once all the backends have finished using MPI based functions.
 *
 * Since the code of plugins is independant, we can't easily share state across
 * module boundaries. So the simplest solution is to have this shared state
 * inside librobinhood (e.g. mpi_rc and mpi_lock in mpi_rc.c). The actual
 * initialization/cleanup will be performed in the callbacks provided by the
 * plugins as parameters. The goal is to avoid dependencies to MPI inside
 * librobinhood to keep things modular.

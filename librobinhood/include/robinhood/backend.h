 * \section errors Error handling
 *
 * For some backends, pinpointing exactly why an operation failed can be quite a
 * difficult task. In order to facilitate the development of new backends, the
 * following error handling mechanism is implemented:
 *
 * When a backend fails to handle an error properly, that is: set errno to a
 * documented value; it should set errno to \c RBH_BACKEND_ERROR and place an
 * explanation message in \c rbh_backend_error. This message should at best
 * explain what kind of error happened, at worst ask for forgiveness to users.
 *
 * \note Users! Application writers! It is your responsability to report to
 * backend maintainers when such an error occurs so that they may try their best
 * to come up with an updated error interface that allows you to gracefully
 * handle the error.

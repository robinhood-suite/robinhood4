 *
 * Ring buffer with multiple readers
 *
 * To create a ring buffer with multiple readers, use rbh_ringr_new() and
 * rbh_ringr_dup().
 *
 * Example: Create a ring buffer of 4K bytes with 2 readers
 *
 *     reader_0 = rbh_ringr_new(1 << 12);
 *     reader_1 = rbh_ringr_dup(reader_0);
 *
 *     0                              4K
 *     --------------------------------
 *     |             ring             |
 *     --------------------------------
 *     ^
 *     reader_0, reader_1
 *
 * To push data, use rbh_ringr_push().
 *
 * Example: Push 16 bytes into the ring buffer
 *
 *     address = rbh_ringr_push(reader_0, "abcdefghijklmnop", 16);
 *
 *     0                              4K
 *     --------------------------------
 *     abcdefghijklmnop               |
 *     --------------------------------
 *     ^
 *     address, r0, r1
 *
 * To access data in a ring from a reader PoV, use rbh_ringr_peek().
 *
 * Example: Peek at the ring from the first reader PoV
 *
 *     address = rbh_ringr_peek(reader_0, &readable_bytes)
 *
 *     0                              4K
 *     --------------------------------
 *     abcdefghijklmnop               |
 *     --------------------------------
 *     ^
 *     r0, readable_bytes = 16
 *
 * To ack data from a reader PoV, use rbh_ringr_ack().
 *
 * Example: Ack 12 bytes from the first reader PoV
 *
 *     rbh_ringr_ack(reader_0, 12);
 *
 *     0                              4K

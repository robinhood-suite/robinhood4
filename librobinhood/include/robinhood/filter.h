/** @file
 * Filters are meant to abstract predicates over the properties of an fsentry
 *
 * \section types Types of filters
 *
 * There are three type of filters: comparison filters, logical filters, and
 * the NULL filter.
 *
 * To distinguish comparison filters from logical filters, one needs only to
 * look at its operator (cf. rbh_is_comparison_operator() and
 * rbh_is_logical_operator()).
 *
 * \subsection comparison Comparison filters
 *
 * Comparison filters represent a single predicate:
 *
 *     an fsentry's name matches '.*.c'
 *
 * They are made of three parts:
 *   - a field: \c "an fsentry's name";
 *   - an operator: \c "matches";
 *   - a value: \c ".*.c".
 *
 * Here is a table that presents valid combinations of
 * comparison operator / value type:
 *
 * |          | EQUAL | LOWER/GREATER | REGEX | IN | BITS |
 * |----------|:-----:|:-------------:|:-----:|:--:|:----:|
 * | BINARY   |   X   |       X       |       |    |      |
 * | INTEGERS |   X   |       X       |       |    |   X  |
 * | STRING   |   X   |       X       |       |    |      |
 * | REGEX    |   X   |       X       |   X   |    |      |
 * | SEQUENCE |   X   |       X       |       |  X |      |
 * | MAP      |   X   |       X       |       |    |      |
 *
 * Using LOWER/GREATER operators with any value type other than INTEGERS, while
 * considered to be a valid filter may yield different result depending on the
 * backend that will interpret them. Refrain from using them unless you know
 * what you are doing.
 *
 * \subsection logical Logical filters
 *
 * Logical filters are combinations of other filters:
 *
 *     (filter_A and filter_B) or not filter_C
 *
 * They are made of two parts:
 *    - an operator: \c "and", \c "or", \c "not";
 *    - a list of filters: \c "filter_A", \c "filter_B", and "filter_C".
 *
 * \subsection null NULL filter
 *
 * Technically, there is a third type of filters: the NULL filter.
 *
 * NULL is a valid filter that matches everything.
 *
 * Conversely, the negation of a NULL filter:
 *
 * ```
 * const struct rbh_filter *FILTER_NULL = NULL;
 * const struct rbh_filter FILTER_NOT_NULL = {
 *     .op = FOP_NOT,
 *     .logical = {
 *         .filters = &FILTER_NULL,
 *         .count = 1,
 *     },
 * };
 * ```
 *
 * matches nothing.

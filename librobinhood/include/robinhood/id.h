/**
 * A unique identifier for an fsentry
 *
 * An ID is a generic data type that can contain arbitrary data.
 *
 * They are used to uniquely identify fsentries throughout a filesystem's life.
 *
 * IDs have two fields:
 *   - \c data: a pointer to arbitrary data;
 *   - \c size: the number of bytes data points at
 *
 * As a convention an ID with a \c size of 0 is used to represent a filesystem
 * root's parent fsentry (something that does not exist).
 *
 * IDs are generally (if not always) built from file handles (cf.
 * name_to_handle_at(2)) or equivalents.

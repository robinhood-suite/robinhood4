# The connection string to indicate to the mongo backend where and how to
# connect to the MongoDB database. If not set, the mongo backend will use
# "mongodb://localhost:27017".
#
# See https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/connection-string/ for more
# information about connection string.
mongodb_address: "mongodb://localhost:27017"

# Map to indicate the type of each xattrs expected to find and to use the
# appropriate type to store them in Mongo. If not set, all xattrs will be stored
# as a binary. Also, all xattrs not set in the map will be store as a binary.
#
# The types available are: int32, int64, uint32, uint64, string, boolean and
# binary
#
# The map should be constructed as follow:
# xattrs_map:
#       xattr_1: type
#       xattr_2: type
#       ...
#
# Example:
# xattrs_map:
#    user.blob_int32: int32
#    user.blob_string: string
#    user.blob_boolean: boolean

# Name of the xattr used to store the expiration date of a file or directory.
# It will be used by the retention. If not set, the retention will search the
# "user.expires" xattr by default.
RBH_RETENTION_XATTR: user.expires

# Map of the backends available for synchronisation. Each backend has a name
# which is usable as the rbh-sync backend name, and must correspond to a map
# containing at least the 'extends' key, specifying the plugin to extend. This
# same map can also contain other values ('iterator' for POSIX plugins for
# instance), and they will be read by the plugin to determine additional
# behaviour.

# Map containing aliases to define a list of pre-filled parameters that will
# be put as-is if requested in the tools implementing aliases.
#
# The map should be constructed as follow:
# alias:
#     first_alias: string
#     second_alias: string
#
# Example:
# alias:
#     blob1: "-name blob -printf '%A'"
#     blob2: "-type dir -user blob"
#     ...

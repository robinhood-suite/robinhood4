      "message": "question: if I understand this correctly, this is to avoid overwriting what enrich_lustre does in posix_enrich, right ? The issue I have with this is that once enriched, the xattr should be removed from the enrich map. So why do you need to do this? It seems to me that it\u0027s the Lustre enricher that should remove the enriched xattrs between the call to enrich_lustre and enrich_posix.\n\nAlso, this modification should be mentioned in the commit message. It took me some time to understand.",

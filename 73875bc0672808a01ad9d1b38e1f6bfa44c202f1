Mongo to mongo seems to logically keep all information, but if we are synchronizing from Mongo to MPI File?\n\nI do understand why you want that feature to be in, and I agree. Just not sure we can ensure that, and for every storage backend.",

Others will just ignore some of the given values, like mpifile, which will not keep \"posix\" and \"lustre\" as source backends but just \"mpifile\", since it can\u0027t do everything \"posix\" can, and cannot do anything \"lustre\" related.\n\nThe calls will be generic, but what each backend does with that information will be their own decision.",

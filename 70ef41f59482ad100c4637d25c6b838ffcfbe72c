      "message": "Yes exactly. When Lustre undelete (import) an entry, it creates a new one with the same information, but a different FID. For us, since a Lustre entry has an id equivalent to the Lustre FID, that means a completely new entry. So after an undelete, we will have a new entry in the database, corresponding to the undeleted entry, and the old one (which has no hard link anymore). The old one can thus be removed from the DB.",

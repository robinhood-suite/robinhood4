      "message": "suggest: maybe in another patch (or even something to discuss between us before) but we could have a boolean in the rbh_backend structure indicating whether the backend support filtering. This could even be a bit field because I imagine that other options might be setup in the same way. The other weird thing about this code is that we call posix_backend_branch_from_path for all of the backends listed here. This is very implementation specific. But for now, this will do.",

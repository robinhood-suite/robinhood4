In this case, for optional features, maybe we shouldn\u0027t have a fallback. Which means that if the key is not in the configuration, we won\u0027t retrieve the attribute.",

      "message": "This change can be made in another patch. This can be landed as is. But we should definitely save this for later. To gain a few extra performance, I think we should avoid computing the retentition and store it in the DB if it\u0027s not used. As for how we configure it, both option are fine. I think I prefer \"if it\u0027s not in the config, it\u0027s not used\". Rather than an explicit flag to disable it. But I don\u0027t have a strong opinion about this.",

      "message": "Okay, the `info` field only concerns instantiated backends. And capabilities are available for backends, in general. Even if they can also be retrieved for instantiated backends. `rbh-info -c rbh:mongo:demo` could be a valid command.\n\nMaybe the issue is the command try to target two \"kind of\" different things. Well, if that\u0027s ok with the other devs, I will not block this patch.",
